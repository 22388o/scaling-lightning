# Project use cases

Scaling lightning will start a test network of lightning nodes using docker and kubernetes and can be used for:

1. Part of a local dev environment to build lightning apps and services
2. To test a lightning application on a build or CI/CD server

In the future, the project would also like to enable easier testing for interopability and regression testing of lightning implementations as well as facilitating research on lightning.

Another area of interest is to help facilitate signet networks such as plebnet.
