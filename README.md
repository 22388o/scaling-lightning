# Scaling Lightning

This is an initiative to bring forward conversation, ideas, problems around scaling & stress-testing the Lightning protocol, implementations, Node Management systems, LSPs and other applications.

Currently, there are many unknowns and untested assumptions about how the Lightning Network will scale when faced with sharp increase in real-world usage and exponential growth. 

We need to be able to test these assumptions and find the limits of the protocol, implementations and applications.

## Goal of this initiative

The goal is to test the limits of the Lightning Network and the impact of exponential growth on the protocol, implementations and applications by:

* Create a long-running "lightning-test-network" to simplify testing and benchmarking for developers.
* Create a framework for developers to easily create a local test network or join the shared test network.
* Simplify orchestration of large scale stress-tests on the Lightning Network where we can simulate exponential growth, transaction spikes, network attacks.
